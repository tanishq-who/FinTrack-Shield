---

## 1. Problem Understanding, Scope & Threat Model

### 1.1 Problem Statement & Real-World Motivation
*Describe the specific problem your project solves, why it matters, and the core security challenges involved.*

### 1.2 Target Users & Personas
*Identify target user groups, their operational workflows, and their trust levels (e.g. End User, Admin, Auditor).*

### 1.3 Threat Model & Attack Surface
*Document the threat landscape for this system:*
- **Critical Assets:** (e.g., user credentials, PII, sensitive business records, session tokens)
- **Potential Attack Vectors:** (e.g., credential stuffing, injection attacks, privilege escalation, unauthorized API access)
- **OWASP Top 10 Considerations:** (e.g., broken access control, cryptographic failures, injection prevention)

## 2. Technical Architecture & Secure System Design

### 2.1 High-Level Architecture Overview
*Describe the multi-tier system structure (Client / API Gateway / Domain Services / Data Persistence).*

### 2.2 Data Flow & Component Interaction
*Outline how requests traverse the system from ingress to storage and back, highlighting trust boundaries.*

### 2.3 Technology Stack Rationale
*Explain the tools selected and why alternatives were rejected:*
- **Backend / API Framework:** (e.g., FastAPI, Express, Go Gin) — *Why chosen:*
- **Frontend / Client:** React 18 + Vite (SPA with pure SVG charts, decoupled service layer, dark navy & white surface fintech theme, WCAG AA compliance) — *Why chosen: Fast bundling, component modularity, zero heavy chart dependencies, decoupled data service layer allowing seamless backend endpoint integration.*
- **Database & Persistence:** (e.g., PostgreSQL, SQLite, Redis) — *Why chosen:*
- **Authentication & Cryptography:** (e.g., Bcrypt/Argon2, PyJWT) — *Why chosen:*

### 2.4 Defense-in-Depth Security Controls
*Detail the specific security controls implemented:*
1. **Authentication & Session Security:** (e.g., salted password hashing, short-lived signed tokens)
2. **Authorization & Access Control:** (e.g., role-based access control, object-level permission checks)
3. **Input Validation & Sanitization:** (e.g., strict schema validation, query parameterization to prevent SQLi)
4. **Rate Limiting & Abuse Prevention:** (e.g., IP/token bucket throttling on public endpoints)
5. **Secrets & Configuration Hygiene:** (e.g., zero hardcoded credentials, 100% environment variable isolation)
